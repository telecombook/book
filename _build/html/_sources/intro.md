# Telecommunication Theory: An Intuitive Understanding

The objective of this TelecomBook is to facilitate an intuitive understanding of telecommunication systems through mathematical and programming languages. 

For each concept:
- A _formal definition_ will be presented in words and/or mathematical terms.
- We try to discuss the _physical meaning_ of the concept, where applicable.
- We aim to _illustrate_ each concept through simulations and/or examples, striving to intuitively explain the essence of its definition and mathematical representation.

The content of this book will undergo continual revisions and updates.

We look forward to receiving your feedback, including perspectives, comments, corrections, and suggestions, which can be sent to telecombook@outlook.com . Thank you for expressing your interest.
