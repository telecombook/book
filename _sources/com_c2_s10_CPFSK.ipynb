    "## Continuous-Phase Frequency-Shift Keying (CPFSK)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues of FSK\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we examine a class of digital modulation techniques in which the signal phase is constrained to remain continuous throughout the transmission process, it means that the phase of the signal does not undergo any abrupt changes or jumps during the modulation process. Instead, it evolves smoothly over time, ensuring that there are no sudden transitions between phase values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imposing this requirement on the phase leads to a modulator—either phase-based or frequency-based—that inherently exhibits memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conventional FSK (Frequency-Shift Keying) signal is typically generated by shifting the carrier frequency by an increment $m\\Delta f$, where $1 \\leq m \\leq M$. Here, $M = 2^k$ represents the total number of available frequencies, and each frequency corresponds to one of the possible $k$-bit symbols to be transmitted. In this conventional approach, the frequency shift is achieved by selecting from among $M$ separate oscillators, each tuned to a specific frequency. When a new $k$-bit symbol arrives, the system switches to the oscillator associated with that symbol for the duration of one signaling interval, $T = k/R$ seconds, where $R$ is the symbol rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although straightforward to implement, this abrupt switching from one oscillator output to another at symbol boundaries produces significant spectral side lobes outside the main lobe of the transmitted signal. As a result, conventional FSK systems require a larger bandwidth to accommodate these side lobes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate this bandwidth expansion, **Continuous-Phase FSK (CPFSK)** modifies the carrier frequency in a smooth and continuous manner. Instead of abruptly jumping from one frequency to another, the information-bearing signal continuously modulates a single carrier, ensuring that the phase of the transmitted signal remains continuous. This property leads to a so-called “memory” in the modulator, since the phase at any given time depends on its history.\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a mathematical representation of CPFSK, one typically begins by expressing the information signal in the form of a Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) signal. This PAM representation provides a convenient basis for describing how the frequency changes continuously over each symbol interval while preserving phase continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the motivation of using CPFSK is:\n",
    "- To avoid the large spectral side lobes caused by abrupt frequency changes, CPFSK ensures continuous frequency modulation.  \n",
    "- The carrier’s frequency is modulated smoothly, maintaining phase continuity, hence the name *continuous-phase FSK*.  \n",
    "- The memory in CPFSK arises from this phase continuity.  \n",
    "- The representation of CPFSK begins with a Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) signal, which serves as the base for defining the frequency-modulated waveform."
