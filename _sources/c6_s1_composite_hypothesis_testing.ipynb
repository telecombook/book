    "When the density functions $ p(\\vec{\\theta}_0) $ and $ p(\\vec{\\theta}_1) $ are unknown, direct application of Bayesian methods becomes impossible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can apply **Maximum-Likelihood (ML) techniques**, which can estimate the parameters $ \\vec{\\theta}_0 $ and $ \\vec{\\theta}_1 $ directly from the observed data $ \\vec{y} $. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is often referred to as the **Generalized Likelihood-Ratio Test (GLRT)**, though this terminology can vary among authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Maximum-Likelihood Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the ML technique is to evaluate the likelihood ratio by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihoods under each hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "**General Maximization of the Likelihood Ratio**\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to directly maximize the likelihood ratio over both parameter sets $ \\vec{\\theta}_0 $ and $ \\vec{\\theta}_1 $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max_{\\vec{\\theta}_1, \\vec{\\theta}_0} \\left[ \\frac{p_1(\\vec{y} | \\vec{\\theta}_1)}{p_0(\\vec{y} | \\vec{\\theta}_0)} \\right].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It means that we find the combination of parameter values $ \\vec{\\theta}_1 $ and $ \\vec{\\theta}_0 $ that maximizes the ratio of likelihoods for each hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation is effective when we want the optimal ratio over all possible parameter values, though itâ€™s computationally intensive and may not always yield unique results.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It means that we independently find the parameter values $ \\vec{\\theta}_1 $ and $ \\vec{\\theta}_0 $ that maximize the likelihoods under $ H_1 $ and $ H_0 $, respectively. \n",

    "\n",
    "This approach treats the ML estimates as if they were the true parameter values, substituting them into the likelihood functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of GLRT\n",
    "\n",
    "The **GLRT** using the ML estimates assumes that the unknown parameters can be reasonably well approximated by their ML estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "By substituting these estimates into the likelihood functions, we effectively reduce the problem to a simpler likelihood ratio test with fixed parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is particularly useful when $ p_0(\\vec{y}) $ represents a **noise-only hypothesis**, meaning that under $ H_0 $, thereâ€™s only noise and no signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, maximizing the likelihood under $ H_1 $ often identifies the presence of a signal, as the noise-only hypothesis yields relatively low likelihood values for structured signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caution with GLRT\n",
    "\n",
    "While the GLRT is intuitive and straightforward, it is not guaranteed to be optimal. This is because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter Estimation Errors**: Using ML estimates does not account for the uncertainty in the parameter estimates themselves, which can lead to suboptimal decisions.\n",
    "- **Potential Bias**: The GLRT may favor one hypothesis if the ML estimates systematically differ from the true values due to noise or other effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, the GLRT is widely used in practice for situations with unknown parameters, offering a pragmatic solution when full Bayesian methods are infeasible."
