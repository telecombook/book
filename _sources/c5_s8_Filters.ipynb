    "## Filtering Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we demonstrated that an optimal detector in the presence of additive Gaussian noise can be constructed by using correlators. \n",
    "\n",
    "These correlators operate by computing the dot product of the measurement vector, denoted as $ \\vec{\\mathbf{y}} $, with each of two locally generated vectors, $ \\vec{h}_0^* $ and $ \\vec{h}_1^* $.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the measurement vector $ \\vec{\\mathbf{y}} $ as a sequence of sampled values over time, it can be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{\\mathbf{y}} = [\\mathbf{y}] = [\\mathbf{y}_1, \\mathbf{y}_2, \\ldots, \\mathbf{y}_k]^T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each $ \\mathbf{y}_i $ in the sequence is a sample taken at regular intervals, with $ T_s $ denoting the duration between consecutive sampling times.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to using correlators in this context is to replace them with a **digital filter**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This filter would have an impulse response that is designed to achieve a similar effect to the correlator. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, the digital filter processes the sampled sequence in such a way that it emphasizes or isolates the characteristics of the signal associated with the hypotheses represented by $ \\vec{h}_0^* $ and $ \\vec{h}_1^* $."
