    "### Probabilistic Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A probabilistic model is a mathematical framework to describe an experiment or process that involves uncertainty. It captures all possible outcomes and their associated probabilities, allowing for analysis and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition of Event  \n",
    "\n",
    "An event represents a specific subset of outcomes from the sample space that we are interested in. For example, in a dice roll, the event of rolling an even number corresponds to the subset {2, 4, 6}.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Three Fundamental Components to Define a Probability \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Space ($ \\mathbb{S} $)**  \n",
    "   The sample space is the universal set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. For a coin toss, $ \\mathbb{S} = \\{ \\text{Heads}, \\text{Tails} \\} $. It serves as the foundational set from which events are defined.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class of Events ($ \\mathsf{E} $)**  \n",
    "   This is the collection of subsets of the sample space $ \\mathbb{S} $. Each subset represents an event that could be studied. For instance, if $ \\mathbb{S} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} $ for a dice roll, possible events could be $ \\{2, 4, 6\\} $ (rolling an even number) or $ \\{1, 3, 5\\} $ (rolling an odd number).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Probability Law**  \n",
    "   The probability law assigns a value $ \\Pr(A) $ to each event $ A $, quantifying how likely the event is to occur. It adheres to specific axioms, ensuring that probabilities are non-negative, sum to 1 across all possible outcomes, and are additive for disjoint events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special Types of Events  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sure Event**  \n",
    "   A sure event is the entire sample space $ \\mathbb{S} $, representing a scenario where every possible outcome occurs. For example, when rolling a die, the event of rolling any number between 1 and 6 is a sure event.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null/Impossible Event**  \n",
    "   This refers to the empty set ($ \\varnothing $) and represents an event that cannot occur. For instance, rolling a 7 on a standard six-sided die is a null event."

    "\n",
    "The assignment of probabilities to events is a fundamental task in probability theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, any assignment that satisfies the axioms of probability is valid. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, depending on the context, different approaches are used to assign probabilities to specific events. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two widely recognized approaches are the **classical approach** and the **relative frequency approach**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical approach to probability is used in experiments where all outcomes are equally likely. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method involves specifying all possible outcomes of the experiment, referred to as **atomic outcomes**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Atomic outcomes are the most basic events in a sample space and cannot be decomposed further.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are $ M $ mutually exclusive and exhaustive atomic outcomes, the probability of each atomic outcome is assigned as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pr(\\text{Atomic outcome}) = \\frac{1}{M}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The sample space consists of six atomic outcomes: $ \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} $. Since the die is fair, the probability of each outcome is:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pr(\\text{each side}) = \\frac{1}{6}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical approach assumes symmetry and equal likelihood among all outcomes, making it ideal for situations like dice rolls, coin tosses, or card draws from a well-shuffled deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relative Frequency Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative frequency approach defines probability based on repeated observations or experiments. This method is particularly useful when outcomes are not assumed to be equally likely or when probabilities need to be estimated empirically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of an event $ A $ is calculated as the long-run relative frequency of $ A $ occurring in repeated trials of the experiment. Mathematically, this is expressed as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pr(A) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n_A}{n},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ n_A $: The number of times event $ A $ occurs.\n",
    "- $ n $: The total number of trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "To estimate the probability of heads in a coin toss, the coin can be flipped $ n $ times. If heads appears $ n_{\\text{heads}} $ times, the relative frequency approximation is:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pr(\\text{Heads}) \\approx \\frac{n_{\\text{heads}}}{n}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As $ n $ increases, the relative frequency converges to the true probability.\n",
    "\n",
