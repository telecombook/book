    "**Definition: Random Process**  \n",
    "A **random process** is a function that depends on both the elements of a sample space, $ S $, and an independent variable, $ t $. Given an experiment $ E $ with sample space $ S $, a random process $ X(t) $ maps each possible outcome $ \\xi \\in S $ to a function of $ t $, denoted as $ x(t, \\xi) $, according to a specific rule.\n",
