# Telecom Book

In this book, we cover the fundamentals of three main topics:  
- Probability theory  
- Signal representation and analysis  
- Telecommunications theory  
- Signal detection, decision, and estimation theory  

A **significant strength** of this book is that nearly all mathematical concepts are illustrated through simulation. Furthermore, most theoretical results are validated by simulated results.
