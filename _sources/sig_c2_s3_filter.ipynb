    "This example demonstrates how to generate, process, and analyze a signal with specific frequency components and noise, and how a lowpass filter isolates desired frequencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Signal Generation**:\n",
    "  - A signal is created with a duration of **1 second**, sampled at a rate of **1 kHz** (1000 samples per second). This means the signal will have **1000 samples** for the 1-second duration.\n",
    "  - The signal consists of two sinusoidal tones:\n",
    "    - A **low-frequency tone** at **100 Hz**.\n",
    "    - A **high-frequency tone** at **300 Hz**.\n",
    "  - **Amplitude adjustment**: The amplitude of the 300 Hz tone is set to **twice that of the 100 Hz tone**, making it more prominent in the signal.\n",
    "  - **Noise addition**: Gaussian white noise with a variance of $ \\frac{1}{100} $ is added to simulate a realistic noisy environment. White noise introduces random variations across all frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lowpass Filtering**:\n",
    "  - A **lowpass filter** is applied to the signal. This filter is designed to pass frequencies below a certain threshold and attenuate higher frequencies.\n",
    "  - The threshold (passband frequency) is set to **200 Hz**, meaning:\n",
    "    - The low-frequency component at 100 Hz is retained.\n",
    "    - The high-frequency component at 300 Hz is attenuated or removed, along with any noise above 200 Hz."

    "   - **Spectra** (frequency-domain representations) of both signals are plotted:\n",
