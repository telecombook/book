    "## Unknown Amplitude\n",
    "\n",
    "Radio systems often operate over channels where the amplitude of the received signal is a random variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common example of this phenomenon is the multipath fading channel, characterized by the many propagation paths from the transmitter to the receiver. \n",
    "\n",
    "The total received signal from these many paths, *i.e.*, multipath, exhibits an amplitude that is the result of mutual interference, sometimes constructive and sometimes destructive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specific examples of multipath fading channels include\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The high-frequency (HF) skywave channel, which allows communications between geographically distant sites by the refraction of radio waves through the earth’s ionosphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The relatively large beamwidths of the antennas and natural irregularities in the ionosphere cause the multipath phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The troposcatter channel, which allows communications between distant sites by the scattering of radio waves from molecules in the earth’s troposphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Almost any high-resolution radar system, where the received signal is composed of reflections from many different portions of the “target.”\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The mobile radio communication channel, where the resultant signal can be composed of both a direct path and various multipath reflections from nearby structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the nature of these types of channels, it is usually impractical or impossible to estimate the phase of the received signal. Thus, we are concerned with a situation where both the *amplitude* and *phase* are random variables.\n"
