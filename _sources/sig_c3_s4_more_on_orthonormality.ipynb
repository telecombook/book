    "#### Orthonormality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Orthonormality** is a fundamental property of a set of functions (or vectors) in a function space (or vector space). \n",
    "\n",
    "A set of functions $\\{\\Theta_i(t)\\}$ is said to be orthonormal if each pair of distinct functions is orthogonal, and each function is normalized. Formally, this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Orthogonality:**  \n",
    "  Two functions $\\Theta_i(t)$ and $\\Theta_j(t)$ are orthogonal if their inner product is zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Kronecker delta function**, denoted by $\\delta_{ij}$, serves as a concise way to express the orthonormality condition. It is defined as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of orthonormal functions, the inner product between any two functions in the set is given by the Kronecker delta:\n",

    "\n",
    "This equation succinctly captures both orthogonality (when $i \\neq j$) and normalization (when $i = j$) in a single expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completeness** ensures that the orthonormal set of functions spans the entire function space under consideration. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that any arbitrary function $s(t)$ within the space can be expressed as a (possibly infinite) linear combination of the orthonormal basis functions:\n",

    "s(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} s_i \\Theta_i(t),\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, **completeness** guarantees that the orthonormal set is sufficient to represent any function in the space without omission. \n",
