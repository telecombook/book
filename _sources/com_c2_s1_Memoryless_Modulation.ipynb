    "## Memoryless Modulation Schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "Memoryless modulation schemes transmit each symbol independently without relying on previous symbols. These schemes are fundamental in digital communications, enabling efficient and reliable data transmission by varying specific signal parameters.\n",

    "### Waveform\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition of $ s_m(t) $:**\n",
    "  - In digital communication systems, $ s_m(t) $ represents the **signal waveform** corresponding to the $ m $-th symbol in a modulation scheme.\n",
    "  - Each symbol $ m $ encodes a specific sequence of binary bits, and $ s_m(t) $ is the time-domain representation of that symbol used for transmission over the communication channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Characteristics of $ s_m(t) $:**\n",
    "  - **Real-Valued:** Typically, $ s_m(t) $ is a **real-valued** function because it represents physical electrical signals, such as *voltage* or *current*, that vary over time.\n",
    "  - **Bandpass Signal:** \n",
    "    - **Bandpass Characteristics:** Most practical communication systems use **bandpass signals**, meaning $ s_m(t) $ occupies a specific frequency band centered around a carrier frequency. This is essential for efficient transmission over mediums like radio frequencies.\n",
    "    - Bandpass signals allow multiple communication channels to coexist without interference and are compatible with antenna transmission, which inherently operates in the bandpass domain.\n",

    "    Waveforms $ s_m(t) $ used for transmission can take **any form**.\n",
