    "- Digital data are typically represented as a **stream of binary digits** (0s and 1s).  \n",
    "- These data can originate from:  \n",
    "  - A **digital source** (e.g., ASCII-encoded text from a computer terminal).  \n",
    "  - The **analog-to-digital conversion** of an analog source (e.g., digital audio or video).  \n",
    "- The primary objective is to **reliably transmit** this data to the destination using the available communication channel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Modulation is Needed?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "To transmit the binary stream over a communication channel, we must **generate a signal** that:  \n",
    "  - **Encodes the binary data**, allowing retrieval of the original stream.  \n",
    "  - **Matches the channel characteristics**, ensuring its **bandwidth** aligns with the channel’s limitations.  \n",
    "  - **Withstands impairments** introduced by the channel, such as noise or interference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This process of converting a digital sequence into a signal for transmission is known as **digital modulation** or **digital signaling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modulation typically involves mapping a real-valued digital sequence (e.g., codewords) to a complex-valued signal using a specific modulation constellation. This lowpass-modulated signal is then shifted to a higher carrier frequency, to obtain a bandpass signal, for transmission. In this chapter, we focus on the mapping process in modulation."

    "- In modulation, the transmitted signals are typically **bandpass signals**, ensuring they fit within the bandwidth allocated by the communication channel.  \n",
    "- The mapping between the digital sequence (assumed to be binary) and the transmitted signal sequence can be either **memoryless** or **with memory**, leading to **memoryless modulation schemes** and **modulation schemes with memory**.  \n",
    "- In a **memoryless modulation scheme**, the binary sequence is divided into **sub-sequences, bit-blocks, or messages**, each of length $ k $. Each **$ k $-bit block** is then mapped to one of the possible signals $ s_m (t) $, where $ 1 \\leq m \\leq 2^k $, without dependence on previously transmitted signals.  \n",
    "- This scheme corresponds to a **mapping** from $ M = 2^k $ **messages** to $ M $ possible **signals**.  "

    "\n",
    "We map a **message**, which is a sequence of $k$ binary bits, to a **symbol** represented by a point on a specific constellation diagram. Each symbol corresponds to a unique combination of bits and is depicted as a complex-valued point, indicating its amplitude and phase. This complex-valued symbol is then converted into an analog signal **waveform**, $s_m(t), 1\\leq m \\leq M, M = 2^k$, which is transmitted over the communication channel.\n",

    "The term **symbol** used in this context aligns with its use in **Symbol Error Rate (SER)**, a key performance metric in digital communication systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In digital modulation, a **symbol** represents a distinct **waveform** (or signal) that is transmitted within a given **signaling interval** $ T_s $. Each symbol corresponds to a group of **bits** (e.g., in **QPSK**, one symbol represents **2 bits**; in **16-QAM**, one symbol represents **4 bits**).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Symbol Error Rate (SER)** measures the probability that a transmitted **symbol** is received incorrectly due to **channel noise, interference, or distortion**. It is defined as:  \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\text{SER} = \\frac{\\text{Number of symbol errors}}{\\text{Total number of transmitted symbols}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each symbol may represent multiple bits, **SER is related to Bit Error Rate (BER)**, but **BER accounts for individual bit errors**, whereas SER considers errors at the symbol level. The relationship between SER and BER depends on the modulation scheme.  \n",
