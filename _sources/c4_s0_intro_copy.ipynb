    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to represent signals accurately in these domains is essential for designing effective communication systems, especially when dealing with **limited bandwidth** and the challenges of **noise**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter focuses on **signal representation**, exploring the conversion between passband and baseband signals, discrete representations, and noise modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also delves into the mathematical tools used for signal decomposition, such as orthonormal expansions, Gram-Schmidt procedures, and the Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansion, which are pivotal in both deterministic and stochastic signal processing."
