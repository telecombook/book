    "**Definition: Band-Limited Signal**  \n",
    "A **deterministic real signal** $ x(t) $ with Fourier transform $ X(f) $ is said to be **band-limited** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X(f) = 0, \\quad \\text{for } |f| > W,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ W $ is the highest frequency contained in $ x(t) $.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Such a signal can be uniquely represented by discrete samples taken at a rate of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_s \\geq 2W \\quad \\text{samples per second}.\n",

    "### Sampling of Complex-Valued Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "For **complex-valued signals**, the bandwidth $ W $ is defined as **half** of the **frequency support** of the signal. That is, if $ W_1 $ and $ W_2 $ denote the lowest and highest frequency components, respectively, then:\n",

    "#### Degrees of Freedom in Sampled Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of **complex signals**, each sampled value is **complex-valued**, meaning that two real numbers are required to represent each sample. This leads to the following observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **real signal** can be fully described using **$ 2W $ real numbers per second**, meaning it has **$ 2W $ degrees of freedom** or **real dimensions per second**.\n",
    "- A **complex signal** has **$ 4W $ degrees of freedom per second**, which is equivalent to **$ 2W $ complex dimensions** or **$ 4W $ real dimensions per second**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aliasing in Undersampling\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sampling rate falls **below the Nyquist rate** ($ f_s < 2W $), **frequency aliasing** occurs, where different frequency components become indistinguishable from one another. This results in **irreversible distortion** in the reconstructed signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reconstruction from Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "A **band-limited signal** that is sampled at the **Nyquist rate** can be perfectly **reconstructed** using the **interpolation formula**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x(t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x\\left(\\frac{n}{2W}\\right) \\text{sinc} \\left[ 2W \\left( t - \\frac{n}{2W} \\right) \\right],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\{x(n/2W)\\} $ are the discrete-time samples taken at $ t = n/2W $, with $ n = 0, \\pm1, \\pm2, \\ldots $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reconstruction via Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "An equivalent reconstruction method is to pass the sampled signal through an **ideal lowpass filter** with an **impulse response**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h(t) = \\text{sinc}(2Wt).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This filtering operation ensures that only the original frequency components of the signal are retained, enabling perfect signal reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "These principles form the foundation of **digital signal processing**, ensuring that continuous signals can be accurately represented and recovered from discrete samples."
