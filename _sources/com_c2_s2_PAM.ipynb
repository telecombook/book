    "## Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### PAM Waveform\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) is a modulation scheme in which the amplitude of a pulse is varied according to the digital data being transmitted. \n",
    "\n",
    "In digital PAM, the transmitted signal waveforms can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_m(t) = A_m p(t), \\quad 1 \\leq m \\leq M\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ p(t) $ represents a **pulse waveform** with a duration $ T $.\n",
    "- $ \\{A_m, 1 \\leq m \\leq M\\} $ is a set of $ M $ possible **amplitudes**, which correspond to  **$ M $ distinct symbols** (or constellation points) in the modulation scheme, and each of these symbols corresponds to a unique **$ k $-bit binary sequence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "- $ M $ represents the **number of distinct amplitude levels** (i.e., symbols) in the Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) scheme.\n",
    "- Since digital communication works with bits, we need to map binary data to these amplitude levels.\n",
    "- If each symbol represents a fixed number of bits, say $ k $, then the total number of distinct symbols must be $ 2^k $, since there are $ 2^k $ possible sequences of $ k $ bits.\n",
    "- This means that **each PAM symbol (amplitude level) corresponds to one of $ k $-bit binary sequences**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**   \n",
    "- Suppose **4-PAM** is used ($ M = 4 $). Since $ 4 = 2^2 $, each symbol represents **2 bits**.\n",
    "- The four amplitude levels might be assigned as:\n",
    "  - $ A_1 = -3 $ → \"00\"\n",
    "  - $ A_2 = -1 $ → \"01\"\n",
    "  - $ A_3 = +1 $ → \"10\"\n",
    "  - $ A_4 = +3 $ → \"11\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly, for **8-PAM** ($ M = 8 $), since $ 8 = 2^3 $, each symbol represents **3 bits**, and we would have 8 distinct amplitude levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrete Amplitude Levels in PAM\n",
    "\n",
    "The amplitude levels $ A_m $ in a typical PAM system take **discrete values**, commonly represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A_m = 2m - 1 - M, \\quad m = 1, 2, \\dots, M\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation results in symmetric amplitude levels around zero, meaning the signal amplitudes are distributed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pm1, \\pm3, \\pm5, \\dots, \\pm(M - 1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These discrete levels enable efficient mapping of binary data onto amplitude variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Waveform Shape and Spectral Influence\n",
    "\n",
    "The waveform $ p(t) $ is a **real-valued pulse signal**, and its shape significantly impacts the spectral characteristics of the transmitted PAM signal. The choice of $ p(t) $ determines the **bandwidth** and **spectral efficiency** of the transmission. Common choices for $ p(t) $ include:\n",
    "- **Rectangular pulses**: Simple but spectrally inefficient.\n",
    "- **Raised cosine pulses**: Used to control intersymbol interference (ISI).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Energy of the PAM Signal\n",
    "\n",
    "The **energy** associated with a transmitted PAM signal $ s_m(t) $ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_m = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A_m^2 p^2(t) \\, dt\n",
    "= A_m^2 E_p\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ E_p $ represents the energy contained in the pulse waveform $ p(t) $. This equation shows that the total signal energy is dependent on both the amplitude level $ A_m $ and the energy of the underlying pulse shape $ p(t) $."
