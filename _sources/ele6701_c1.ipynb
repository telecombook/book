    "# Chapter 1: Review of Probability Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter provides a comprehensive review of fundamental concepts in probability theory that are essential for understanding more advanced topics in wireless communications. We will cover key topics such as conditional probability, independence, probability density functions (PDF), cumulative distribution functions (CDF), and functions of random variables. Additionally, we will delve into moments, random variables, and stochastic processes, including stationarity, ergodicity, and power spectral density. The chapter also includes detailed discussions on Gaussian random variables and vectors, both real and complex, which are crucial for modeling and analysis in communication systems."
