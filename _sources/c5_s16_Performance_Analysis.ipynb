    "## Perfomance of Binary Receivers in AWGN\n",
    "\n",
    "In preceding sections, we have derived optimal receiver structures for detecting which of two alternative signals is received in the presence of additive Gaussian noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will examine the performance of the receivers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already know that the receivers are optimal, it may seem strange to be interested in their performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "After all, we know we cannot build anything better under the assumed conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, it is useful to know the performance for at least two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The performance will give us great insight into signal design.\n",
    "2. If, for cost reasons, we desire to build a suboptimal receiver, it is useful to know how much performance degradation we are suffering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We limit ourselves here to receiver structures that are optimal under noise conditions that are Gaussian and white. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the structures are assumed to be phase coherent, implying that a perfect estimate of the received phase is available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we address the performance of the continuous-time signal receivers."
